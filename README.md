# Prediction of Cellular Migration under Galvanotaxis

Description and comparison of LSTM and Gaussian Process (GP) to predict cellular migration under an electric field.

The LSTM code is adapted from Sargent et al. (2022), which can be found here: 
https://github.com/Gomez-Lab/galvanotaxis_cells and the training data is from Arocena et al (2017) found here: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.53512.
